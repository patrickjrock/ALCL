## Differential Diagnosis
> - Hodgkin disease
> - B-cell lymphoma
> - Diffuse large cell lymphoma
> - Malignant histiocytosis
> - Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma (ALCL)
> - Metastatic melanoma
> - Viral infection

---

## Additional Workup

> - Excisional biopsy of lymphadenopathy
> - Bone marrow biopsy
> - Cytogenetics 
> - Immunohistochemistry
> - LDH
> - beta2-microglobulin
>  - LDH and beta2-microglobulin are prognostic indicators associated with tumor activity and size.

## Most Likely Diagnosis

### Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma (ALCL)
> - This rare neoplasm is suggested by large anaplastic cells with horseshoe or 
 embryoid nuclei in Figure 2. 
> - The diagnosis is confirmed by "the presence of rearangements
 in the ALK gene on chromosome 2p23" - Robbins
> - ALK is not expressed in normal lymphocytes so its precense is a good indicator. 
> - These tumors usually express CD30.
 
> - "Immunophenotypically, most neoplastic lymphocytes have a unique CD4+, CD8-, and cytotoxic T-cell phenotype (TIA-1 and granzyme B+), with variable loss of panâ€“T-cell antigens (eg, CD2, CD3, CD5)." -medscape

---

## Course of Management
> - Multifocal presentation requres chemotherapy
   + Methotrexate
   + Combination regimens
   + CHOP *cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone*
     * Most common therapy
> - Surgery (hysterectomy)
> - Recurrance expected within 2 years

---

## Salient Features
> - T-Cell neoplasm
  - CD4+, CD8-, CD30+, 
  - CD30+ is also associated with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma
  - CD30 is the target of Brentuximab Vedotin
> - Usually ALK+
  - ALK- associated with poor prognosis
> - Associated with HSV, syphilis, leishmaniasis, ...
> - Possible association between breast implants and ALCL

## Question 
Which of the following markers is suggestive of ALCL?

1. Hyper-segmented neutrophils
2. Foam cells
3. _Horseshoe cells_
4. Schistocytes
5. FLT3

***.hint
Nuclei are deformed

***.explanation
Horseshoe cells are hallmark for ALCL

1. Megaloblastic anemia
2. Atherosclerosis
3. ALCL
4. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
5. AML
